## Typing Memory Game

This the first MERN stack app I have written.

Click on the Start Game button and you have 3 seconds the memorise the number.
Type the number in the box and click the submit button or hit enter.
The number will increase in length by one digit each time you get it right.
You will also have an extra second to memorise the longer number.

The scoreboard displays the top 10 all time scores

## To Do List

Improve the design of the app.<br />
Improve the scoreboard to include the date of the score.<br />
Better messages to explain whether the user achived a high score or didn't.<br />
Ensure that the same digit is not used consecutively when generating the number.<br />
